## Text Guidelines
Breadcrumbs are a list of links representing the current page and previous in the site hierarchy. Example: 
* [Dashboard / MarkLogic University / On Demand Tutorial Review](https://wiki.marklogic.com/display/MLU/On+Demand+Tutorial+Review)

For breadcrumb labels:
* Use [Title Case](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#capitalization).
* Avoid punctuation.
* Use  short, precise, and related terms to orient users and clearly illustrate page hierarchy. In the following example, MarkLogic wiki users can easily see that they are viewing information about application services within the engineering division:
  * [Dashboard / Engineering Home / Application Services](https://wiki.marklogic.com/display/ENGINEERING/Application+Services)
* Always write breadcrumb labels to match page titles. For exceptionally long page, titles, include the most important terms in the breadcrumb label. For example, the breadcrumb for [How-To: Use Netsuite and the Mobile App (with SSO)](https://wiki.marklogic.com/display/ENGINEERING/On-screen+Text+Guidelines) could be condensed to [SSO for Netsuite & Mobile App](http://wiki.marklogic.com/).
