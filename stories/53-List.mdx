## Usage Guidelines
No Guidelines

## Text Guidelines
* Use [Title Case](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#capitalization) for titles, headings, buttons, and labels.
* Use [Sentence case](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#capitalization) for lists, body text, or any copy that includes a grammatically complete sentence. 
For trademarks, servicemarks, Gradle tasks, file paths, database names, and case-sensitive commands, follow the capitalization exactly as it appears in the UI. Examples:
  * ml-data-hub
  * java -jar marklogic-datahub*.jar

Start list items with a capital letter. Examples:
* Technology
* Databasers
* Compliance

For compound words, capitalize the first letter of the first word. Example:
* On-screen text
