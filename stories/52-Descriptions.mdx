## Text Guidelines
* Use Title Case for titles, headings, buttons, and labels.
* Use Sentence case for lists, body text, or any copy that includes a grammatically complete sentence.
* For trademarks, servicemarks, Gradle tasks, file paths, database names, and case-sensitive commands, follow the capitalization exactly as it appears in the UI. Examples:
  *   ml-data-hub
  *   java -jar marklogic-datahub*.jar

Start list items with a capital letter. Examples:
* Technology
* Databasers
* Compliance

For compound words, capitalize the first letter of the first word. Example:
* On-screen text
